Template for React App with already setup environment with most popular packages.

<br/>Main github repo [snoh666/react-typescript-boilerplate](https://github.com/snoh666/react-typescript-boilerplate)

## Contained packages

- redux:
    - redux-thunk
    - redux-devtools-extension
- styled-components
- eslint & prettier configured into airbnb rules
- typescript compiling
- react-app-rewired (webpack aliases without ejecting)

## Installing and starting

Starting goes the same way as normal CRA.
1. Installing all required packages with `npm install` or `yarn install`
2. Starting up React App `npm start` or `yarn start`
3. Ready to go!

App is prepared to handle `yarn` and also `npm` depending on what you want just delete stuff
related to useless one.

## About

I've wanted to have some kind of less advanced template to use with my side projects.
Later on I've decided on making this real public "template" which other people can really use or learn from

I know It's very hard to always get started on first projects with that kind of libraries as TypeScript or even redux-thunk so that's it!
Feel free to use MR's are really welcome here!
